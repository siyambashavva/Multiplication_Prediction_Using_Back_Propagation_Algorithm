# Multiplication Prediction Using Back Propagation Algorithm
## This project has been assigned as a final assignment for the BIL 429 Introduction to Machine Learning course. The key point of this project is to find the product of two given numbers using the Back Propagation Algorithm with the help of the NumPy library, without using a deep learning library.
